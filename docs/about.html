                        <div class="card-body text-justify">
                            <p>The entire website is formatted around 10 content pages that are broken up over the course
                                of 20 years of data, but is focused around the beginning of the year, specifically January.
                                This was specifically to show the progress in a more efficient manner, as well as compressing
                                content further into a lesser amount of pages. </p>
                            <p>The main website, the index, is meant to be a preview to the content within the 10 pages,
                                with a carousel and cards. The carousel contains 3 of the required 6 public domain pages,
                                as well as quick links to the first, fifth, and 10th content page. For the cards, I chose
                                the two most competitive sites in visits, which were Google and Yahoo, as their logos, and
                                included a collage of different social media sites that are used today. All three pictures
                                are also of public domain. The youtube channel is sourced here.</p>
                            <p>The about page is going to be the html version of this doc in order to create context and
                                show a sense of pattern of what is to be expected throughout the site and the content
                                presented within it. The youtube channel is also sourced here.</p>
                            <p>The Table of Contents, or the site map itself contains the links of the top 10 visited
                                websites over the course of 20 years listed 2 years per site totaling 10 pages. Also,
                                the site map contains the home and about links in the list of links, sectioned off. In
                                addition, there is an extraneous link to the old sitemap that I would have used, just to
                                add some more content to the page than just the links. </p>
                            <p>The content pages themselves contain information for the years they are linked in. Each
                                site has a brief summary of the number of visits for certain sites and follows each one.
                                Also, the sites are accompanied by a graph that can be made bigger by hovering over
                                it with the mouse pointer.  Both graphs are screenshots of January in their respective
                                year from the youtube channel sourced in the Home and About page.</p>
